Fixes were applied based on the results of the User Testing so the prototype will be accessible to the user.

Tester : n.roper-2021@hull.ac.uk

Based on feedback there are some improvements i can make: - From A/B test: Other buttons could be more suitable because they also have text.
- Some improvements can be made with the location of the elements
